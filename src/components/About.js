                <p>While recently spending a lot of time sitting outside, I thought, why not make a fan website for the Great Outdoors? Let's show this nature thing some appreciation. Thus began my latest side project, a sample site to bring the outdoors to you, and you to the outdoors. This site was built using React and is the result of what was initially a challenge to myself to build something responsiveâ€”made both for desktop and mobile devices. Feel free to provide feedback!<br/><br/>
